Neural Networks with Numpy only, and applications, based on sentdex lessons and book. 

There are two different applications: 

1 - Prediction of mouse-drawing numbers using a Neural Network trained with the MNIST hand-written dataset.

2 - Application to the MNIST fashion dataset to predict clothes on images.
